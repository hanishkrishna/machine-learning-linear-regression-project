linear regression dataset
Context
The reason behind providing the data-set is that currently I'm doing my Master's in Computer Science, in my second semester I have chosen Data Science class, so in this class they are teaching me Linear Regression, so I decided to provide a set of x and y values, which not only helps me and also helps others.

Content
The dataset contains x and y values:
x values are just iterating values.
y values depend on the equation y = mx+c.

Inspiration
Everyone on this planet should be familiar (at least Computer Science students, etc.) about Linear Regression, so calculate the trend line, R^2, coefficient and intercept values.
